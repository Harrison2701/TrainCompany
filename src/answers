14) a)  It is possible for a class to have two constructors as long as the two constructors have different parameters.
        The first constructor takes in two strings as parameters while the second parameter doesn't take in any parameters.
    b)

15) a)  For routeCode, the appropriate data type would be string. For delay, the appropriate data type would be int.
        For weatherRelated, the appropriate type would be a boolean.
    c)  "T290", 10, 1

16) a)  4.5
    b)

 18)a)  Inheritance is used to organize classes. With a superclass, it allows subclasses to inherit methods and instance
        variabes from the super class unless stated otherwise. For this example, you can write a class called Transportation.
        Afterwards, you can write another class to extend to Transportation. It allows you to write less code and organize the classes.

 19)a)It would be inefficient when dealing with large array.
    b)

  20)c)    public String convert(Codes[] c){
               for(int i = 0; i < numberOfJourneys; i++){
                   if(c[i] == c[i+1]){
                       //print route code of c[i]
                   }
               }
           }
